# MineSuffocatingTeleporter

Plugin for the Nogard Minecraft server to prevent suffocation when a user leaves the server while in a mine and then re-joins after the mine has been reset. Uses the [EssentialsX API](https://github.com/EssentialsX/Essentials/tree/2.x/Essentials/src/net/ess3/api), [WorldEdit API](https://worldedit.enginehub.org/en/latest/api/), and [WorldGuard API](https://worldguard.enginehub.org/en/latest/developer/).
